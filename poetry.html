			"This book is not about heroes. English Poetry is not yet fit to speak of them. 
			<br>Nor is it about deeds or lands, nor anything about glory, honour, dominion or power,
			<br><span class="indent2">except War.</span>
			<br>
			<br>Above all, this book is not concerned with Poetry.
			<br>The subject of it is War, and the pity of War.
			<br>The Poetry is in the pity.
			<br>Yet these elegies are not to this generation,
			<br><span class="indent2">This is in no sense consolatory.</span>
			<br>
			<br>They may be to the next.
			<br>All the poet can do to-day is to warn.
			<br>That is why the true Poets must be truthful.
			<br>If I thought the letter of this book would last,
			<br>I might have used proper names; but if the spirit of it survives Prussia,
			<br>—my ambition and those names will be content;
			<br>for they will have achieved themselves fresher fields than Flanders."

			This website’s aim is to provide a small selection of Owen’s poetry for introduction to his work. These poems are all from the posthumously published <i>Poems by Wilfred Owen</i> (1920), now available in the public domain. I highly recommended reading the full text, which is available (including the preface copied above and an introduction from Siegfried Sassoon) <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_by_Wilfred_Owen">at Wikisource</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			For more information on the history and meaning of Wilfred Owen’s poetry, I recommend the Wilfred Owen Association’s <a href="http://www.wilfredowen.org.uk/poetry">collection of poetry critiques</a>. They provide great insight into the biographical context of each poem, in addition to literary criticism.
