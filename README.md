## Wilfred Owen : The Poetry and Pity of War
A tribute site for World War I poet Wilfred Owen. HTML &amp; CSS only, minimalist style. The site uses public domain photography and public domain text to describe the life of Wilfred Owen, show examples of his work, and provide a short explanation of the importance of World War I. This project was my first attempt at programming, and is made entirely with CSS & HTML.
